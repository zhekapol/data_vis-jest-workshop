# Data visualization: Beyond a simple bar chart
## workshop on data visualization at JEST (02/11/2022)

## Install dependecies
In case you have Plotly already installed, skip these steps.

1. Create a new Python virtual ambiente.
```
python -m venv .venv
```

2. Switch to the newly created virtual ambient.
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the dependencies. If you are on mac use ```pip3``` instead of ```pip```.
```
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

4. Run Jupyter Notebook
```
jupyter lab notebook.ipynb
```

## After the workshop
After the workshop you can safely deactivate project's virtual environment by running

```
.venv/bin/deactivate
```

If you no longer need the project, just delete the folder, which also removes the virtual environement and all the dependencies.
